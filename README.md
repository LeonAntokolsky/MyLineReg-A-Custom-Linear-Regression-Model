# MyLineReg: A Custom Linear Regression Model

This repository contains the implementation of `MyLineReg`, a custom linear regression model built from scratch using Python, pandas, and NumPy. The model employs gradient descent for optimization and includes functionalities for fitting the model, making predictions, and retrieving model coefficients.

## Features

- **Gradient Descent Optimization**: Implements gradient descent to minimize the mean squared error.
- **Custom Learning Rate and Iterations**: Allows configuration of learning rate and number of iterations for training.
- **Bias Handling**: Automatically adds a bias term to the feature set.
- **Verbose Training**: Provides verbose output to monitor the training process.
- **Predict and Retrieve Coefficients**: Functions to predict outcomes and retrieve model coefficients (weights).
